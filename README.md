# Scooty
Scooty is an Arduino-based multi function control board for a tortoise cage. 
This was initially designed as a food dispenser control board but additional functionality have been added since then. The idea behind this is to automate all the activities performed to care for a pet tortoise such as dispensing food and water, temperature and humidity control, basking lights switching etc.
The primary components included on this board are:
1. Arduino Uno - that runs the main source code to control all the functionalities on this board
2. 4-pin angled header to attach external temp/humidity sensor
3. 3-pin angled header to attach the servo motor
